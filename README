I got interested in learning how to make Chrome extensions when my frustration on using bookmarks reached its limit. I needed something that loaded up common sites without having to look for it in my bookmarks. I began using tutorials that taught me how to create an extension that provided a popup message to learning how to use the omnibox.In the boston_img project, I created an extension that used the word leila in the omnibox as code for opening up the Pinterest page to the Boston Terrier gallery.The boston_info extension provides a popup window with the three links I refer to the most when in search of Boston Terrier solutions.Both of these extensions are simple and super specific to fit my personal needs. Having these extensions make the process of routing to the websites faster than having to look for it within my bookmarks. Not to mention it also allows me to stay organize and get rid of so many favorite on the toolbar.The following are the main tutorials that helped shape my extensions:Omnibox: https://www.lullabot.com/blog/article/creating-simple-chrome-extensionRss-feed: http://tutorialzine.com/2010/06/making-first-chrome-extension/
